            <p>
                I was born on October 4th, 1998, on the cusp of Generation Z. I grew up in a middle-class family in a modest town in India. Exposed to rudimentary technology and a conservative Catholic education, early Gen Zs in India often share characteristics with millennials. My upbringing was geared towards becoming an engineer for NASA, but a rebellious mindset led me away from all things technical. Despite this, I found statistics and predictive analysis fascinating, which steered me towards behavioral psychology and macroeconomics.

                In India, undergraduate students can take on three disciplines, allowing me to study psychology, economics, and English literature. During college, I also explored political science and history, developing a deep appreciation for Orwell and Marx. My passion for history reshaped my perspective on life. The concept of time and space became fluid, and I used historical texts (and sometimes science fiction) to make every place interesting.

            <p>Meanwhile, I traveled across North India, exploring the ruins of vast and prosperous civilizations, tracing the footsteps of great figures like Buddha and Khusrow, and reflecting on India's struggle for independence. Despite my love for the café, I sought new challenges and found a position as a telecom representative for a customer support corporation. However, due to irregularities in pay, I left after three months and decided to pursue further education. I chose to pursue a degree in Business Administration at Cardiff Metropolitan University. This incredible program has equipped me with skills in project management, strategic management, human resource management, and marketing. I will graduate in December 2024. Additionally, I have a passion for public speaking.</p>
